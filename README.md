# Wherwebouttoeatat
I was having trouble deciding where to eat at so I made a script and a mini game
to decide who's paying there are Three Mode to the Minigame

Mode 1 = One Person Pays for everyone

Mode 2 = One Person Pays for a Random amount of people in the party everyone else pays for themeselves


Mode 3 = Everyone in the party pitches in to pay for one person and pay for themselves
